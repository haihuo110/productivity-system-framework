## 🚀 What You'll Build

A complete productivity system including:
- Daily task management
- Weekly reviews
- Habit tracking
- Goal setting (quarterly OKRs)
- Time blocking

## 📋 Prerequisites

Choose your platform:
- **Option A**: Notion (recommended)
- **Option B**: Markdown files + your favorite note app
- **Option C**: Paper-based bullet journal

## ⏱️ 30-Minute Setup

### Week 1: Foundation (Start Here!)

#### Day 1: Set Up Your System (15 minutes)

**For Notion Users:**

1. **Create 3 core databases:**
   - Tasks Database
   - Projects Database  
   - Habits Database

2. **Add these properties to Tasks:**
   - Task (Title)
   - Status (Select: Todo, In Progress, Done)
   - Priority (Select: P1, P2, P3, P4)
   - Due Date (Date)
   - Context (Multi-select: @computer, @phone, @home, @errands)

3. **Create basic views:**
   - Today: Tasks due today
   - This Week: Tasks due this week
   - By Context: Grouped by context tags

**For Other Platforms:**

1. Create a notebook or folder structure:
   ```
   /Productivity System
   ├── Daily Plans/
   ├── Weekly Reviews/
   ├── Projects/
   ├── Goals/
   └── Habits/
   ```

2. Copy templates from `/templates` directory

#### Day 2-7: Use the Daily Plan Template (5 min/day)

1. **Each morning**, create a new daily plan using [templates/daily-plan.md](templates/daily-plan.md)

2. **Identify your Top 3** priorities for the day

3. **Evening**: Mark what you completed, plan tomorrow

**That's it for Week 1!** Just capture tasks and complete your top 3 daily.

---

### Week 2: Add Weekly Reviews (Add 30 min/week)

1. **Choose a time**: Sunday evening or Friday afternoon
2. **Use the template**: [templates/weekly-review.md](templates/weekly-review.md)
3. **Focus on 3 sections**:
   - Empty inboxes
   - Review tasks and projects
   - Plan next week's priorities

---

### Week 3: Start Habit Tracking (Add 2 min/day)

1. **Choose 1-3 habits** to track (don't start with more!)
   - Examples: Morning meditation, exercise, reading

2. **Use the template**: [templates/habit-tracker.md](templates/habit-tracker.md)

3. **Track daily** with a simple checkmark

---

### Week 4: Set Quarterly Goals (Add 1 hour)

1. **Define 3-5 quarterly objectives** using [templates/goal-template.md](templates/goal-template.md)

2. **Break each into 3-5 measurable key results**

3. **Link to your weekly review** - check progress weekly

---

## 🎯 The Minimum System

If you're overwhelmed, just do these 3 things:

1. **Daily Top 3**: Each morning, identify your 3 most important tasks
2. **Weekly Review**: 30 minutes every Sunday to clear your mind
3. **Track 1 Habit**: Choose one keystone habit to build

This alone will put you ahead of 90% of people.

## 📚 Next Steps

Once the basics are solid:

1. **Read the framework**: [docs/framework.md](docs/framework.md)
2. **Deep dive**: Task, time, habits, goals guides in `/docs`
3. **Automate**: Set up scripts from `/scripts` for Notion integration
4. **Customize**: Adapt the system using [docs/customization-guide.md](docs/customization-guide.md)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Daily Habits

- ⏰ **Same time each day**: Plan at same time (e.g., 8 AM daily)
- 📝 **Use templates**: Don't start from scratch
- 🎯 **Top 3 first**: Always complete top 3 before other tasks
- 🌙 **Evening review**: 5 minutes to close the day

### Weekly Review

- 📅 **Calendar it**: Block 60-90 minutes, non-negotiable
- 🧹 **Clear everything**: All inboxes to zero
- 🎉 **Celebrate wins**: Acknowledge what went well
- 🔮 **Plan ahead**: Know your priorities before Monday

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ **Don't track too many habits**: Start with 1-3 max
- ❌ **Don't skip weekly reviews**: This is the keystone habit
- ❌ **Don't over-complicate**: Simple system > complex system ignored
- ❌ **Don't be perfectionist**: Progress > Perfection

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"I'm overwhelmed by all the options"**
→ Use the Minimum System (Top 3, Weekly Review, 1 Habit)

**"I don't have time for this"**
→ Daily: 5 minutes morning, 5 minutes evening
→ Weekly: 30 minutes (saves hours through the week)

**"My days are too unpredictable"**
→ Still identify Top 3. Even if you don't finish them, you know what matters most.

**"I keep forgetting to use the system"**
→ Set phone reminders
→ Stack with existing habit (e.g., "After coffee, review daily plan")
