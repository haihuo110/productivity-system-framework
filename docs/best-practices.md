# Best Practices & Pro Tips

## Getting Started

### Start Simple, Build Gradually

**Week 1: Foundation**
- Set up task capture system
- Create daily planning routine
- Choose one productivity tool (Notion recommended)

**Week 2-4: Core Habits**
- Morning planning (5 minutes)
- Evening review (5 minutes)
- Weekly review (30 minutes)

**Month 2: Expand**
- Add time tracking
- Implement first 1-2 habits
- Set quarterly goals

**Month 3+: Optimize**
- Refine based on what works
- Add automation
- Build on successes

**üëâ Key Principle**: Master the basics before adding complexity.

### The Minimum Viable System

If you're overwhelmed, start with just these three practices:

1. **Capture everything** in one place (Notion inbox)
2. **Daily top 3**: Identify 3 priorities each morning
3. **Weekly review**: 30 minutes every Sunday

This alone will put you ahead of 90% of people.

## Task Management Pro Tips

### Inbox Zero (or Near-Zero)

**The Method:**
- Process inbox daily (or twice daily)
- Every item gets clarified and moved
- Inbox is not a to-do list
- Goal: Empty or <5 items

**Processing Speed:**
- **<2 minutes**: Do it now
- **>2 minutes**: Clarify next action and move
- **Not actionable**: Archive, reference, or delete

### Context-Based Organization

Group tasks by what you need to do them:

```
üíª @computer
   - Deep work requiring full focus
   - Internet research
   - Writing and creating

üìû @phone
   - Calls to make
   - Text messages
   - Voice memos to send

üè¢ @office
   - In-person meetings
   - Office-only resources
   - Face-to-face collaboration

üè† @home
   - Household tasks
   - Family time
   - Personal projects

üë• @people
   - Agenda items for specific people
   - Waiting for responses
   - Delegation follow-ups

‚ö° @quick-wins
   - 5-minute tasks
   - Easy completions
   - Low energy allowed
```

**Pro Tip**: When you have 15 minutes and low energy, knock out everything in @quick-wins.

### The Two-List Method

**List 1: Top 3 Priorities**
- Most important tasks
- Must do today
- Focus until complete

**List 2: Everything Else**
- Only touch after List 1 is done
- Or when context/energy doesn't suit List 1

**Rule**: Never skip List 1 items to work on List 2.

### Project Next Actions

**Every project must have:**
- Clear desired outcome
- Defined next physical action
- Responsible person
- Estimated time

**Weekly check**: Every active project has a next action defined.

**If stuck**: Ask "What would happen next if this project could only move forward?"

### Waiting For System

**Track everything you're waiting on:**
- Delegated tasks
- Information from others
- External dependencies
- Responses needed

**Weekly review**: Check every "waiting for" item
- Need to follow up?
- Has it been too long?
- Can I unblock this?

**Format**:
```
Waiting For: [What] from [Who] since [Date]
Follow-up date: [When to check in]
Next action if no response: [What I'll do]
```

## Time Management Pro Tips

### Time Blocking Mastery

**1. Theme Your Days**

- **Maker Days**: Tuesday/Thursday - deep work, no meetings
- **Manager Days**: Monday/Wednesday - meetings, collaboration
- **Flex Day**: Friday - catch-up, admin, planning

**2. Power Hour**

First hour of workday = most important task, no exceptions.

**Rules:**
- No email
- No Slack
- No meetings
- Phone off
- Just your #1 priority

**3. Batch Similar Tasks**

- Email: 10am and 3pm only (30 min each)
- Meetings: Back-to-back on specific days
- Admin: Friday afternoon 2-4pm
- Content creation: Tuesday morning
- Calls: Thursday 2-5pm

**Benefit**: Reduce context switching, increase flow.

**4. Strategic Breaks**

- **Every 90 minutes**: 10-15 min break
- **Lunch**: Full hour, away from desk
- **Between time blocks**: 5-10 min buffer

**Break activities:**
- Walk outside
- Stretch or move
- Hydrate and snack
- Breathe deeply
- Close eyes and rest

### Energy Management

**Map Your Energy:**

Track for one week:
- When you feel most alert
- When you hit slumps
- What drains you
- What energizes you

**Then schedule:**
- **Peak energy** ‚Üí Most important/creative work
- **High energy** ‚Üí Meetings, collaboration
- **Medium energy** ‚Üí Routine tasks
- **Low energy** ‚Üí Admin, email, planning

**Common patterns:**
- Peak: 9-11 AM, 2-4 PM
- Slump: After lunch (1-2 PM)
- Evening: Good for reflection, planning

### Defend Your Deep Work

**Create Boundaries:**

1. **Block calendar**: Mark as busy
2. **Physical signal**: Headphones on, door closed
3. **Digital shutdown**: Airplane mode, website blocker
4. **Team communication**: "In deep work until [time]"
5. **Alternative contact**: For true emergencies only

**Track it:**
- Goal: 20+ hours deep work per week
- Reality check: Most knowledge workers get <5 hours
- Every hour of deep work = 3-5 hours of shallow work

## Habit Formation Pro Tips

### Stack Your Habits

Build a routine where one habit triggers the next:

**Morning Stack Example:**
```
Alarm ‚Üí Immediately get up (no snooze)
  ‚Üí Make bed
  ‚Üí Drink water
  ‚Üí Bathroom routine
  ‚Üí Put on workout clothes
  ‚Üí 10-min meditation
  ‚Üí 5-min journal
  ‚Üí Review daily priorities
  ‚Üí Start most important task
```

**Result**: One decision (get up) triggers entire chain.

### The Seinfeld Strategy

"Don't break the chain"

**How:**
1. Get a calendar
2. Mark X for each day you do the habit
3. Focus on not breaking the chain

**Why it works:**
- Visual motivation
- Loss aversion (don't want to break streak)
- Simple and satisfying
- No excuse-making

**Pro tip**: Never miss twice in a row.

### Habit Pairing

Attach habit to something you already do:

- Coffee ‚Üí Journaling
- Lunch ‚Üí Walk
- Commute ‚Üí Podcast/audiobook
- Shower ‚Üí Gratitude practice
- Dinner prep ‚Üí Call friend/family

### Make It Stupidly Easy

**2-Minute Rule**: Scale habit down to 2-minute version.

- "Read 30 pages" ‚Üí "Read 1 page"
- "Run 3 miles" ‚Üí "Put on running shoes"
- "Study for an hour" ‚Üí "Open textbook"
- "Write 1000 words" ‚Üí "Write one sentence"

**Goal**: Show up consistently. Duration comes later.

### Environment Design

**Make good habits obvious:**
- Workout clothes laid out
- Book on pillow
- Vitamins next to breakfast
- Water bottle on desk

**Make bad habits invisible:**
- Delete social media apps
- Unplug TV after each use
- Remove junk food
- Use website blockers

## Goal Setting Pro Tips

### Quarterly Sprint

**12 weeks is magic:**
- Long enough for meaningful progress
- Short enough to stay urgent
- Frequent enough to adapt

**Execution tip**: Print OKRs, hang on wall, review daily.

### Focus on Process, Not Outcomes

**Instead of**:
- "Lose 20 pounds"
- "Make $10K"
- "Get promoted"

**Focus on**:
- "Exercise 4x per week"
- "Work on product 10 hours per week"
- "Lead one major project per quarter"

**Why**: You control the process. Outcomes follow.

### The 3-5 Rule

Limit to:
- **3-5 quarterly objectives**
- **3-5 key results per objective**
- **3-5 weekly priorities**
- **3 daily most important tasks**

**Why**: Focus. More = diffusion of effort.

### Lead Measures > Lag Measures

**Lag measures**: Results (weight, revenue, followers)
**Lead measures**: Actions (workouts, sales calls, posts)

**Track both, but focus energy on lead measures.**

Example:
- Lag: Grow email list to 1000
- Lead: Publish 2 blog posts per week, offer 1 lead magnet

### Visible Goals

Place goals where you'll see them daily:

- Desktop wallpaper
- Bathroom mirror
- Desk whiteboard
- Phone lock screen
- Notion dashboard

**Review AM/PM**: "What can I do today to move closer?"

## Weekly Review Mastery

### Non-Negotiable

The weekly review is the keystone habit of productivity.

**Schedule it**: Same time every week
**Protect it**: Like you would an important meeting
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes
**Result**: Crystal clarity on priorities

### The Perfect Weekly Review

**1. Get Clear** (15 min)
- Empty all inboxes
- Collect loose papers, notes, thoughts
- Process everything captured

**2. Get Current** (20 min)
- Review calendar (past and upcoming weeks)
- Review task lists (mark complete, update)
- Review projects (progress, next actions)
- Review waiting-for list

**3. Get Creative** (15 min)
- Review someday/maybe list
- Capture new ideas and opportunities
- Any new projects to start?

**4. Get Perspective** (20 min)
- Review quarterly goals (on track?)
- Assess time allocation (aligned with goals?)
- Check habits (consistency?)
- Celebrate wins (what went well?)

**5. Plan Ahead** (20 min)
- Identify next week's 3-5 priorities
- Schedule deep work blocks
- Plan any needed prep work
- Set daily intentions

### Weekly Review Triggers

**Schedule based on**:
- Friday afternoon (close out week with clarity)
- Sunday evening (prepare for great Monday)
- Saturday morning (weekend mind space)

**Find what works for you, then protect it fiercely.**

## Tool & System Tips

### Notion Best Practices

**1. Keep It Simple**
- Start with basic databases
- Add complexity only as needed
- Aesthetic < Functional

**2. Use Templates**
- Create templates for recurring items
- Daily plan template
- Weekly review template
- Project template
- Meeting notes template

**3. Linked Databases**
- Tasks ‚Üî Projects
- Projects ‚Üî Goals
- Time Entries ‚Üî Tasks
- Habits ‚Üî Goals

**4. Smart Views**
- Today: Scheduled = today
- This Week: Due this week
- By Context: Grouped by @tags
- By Priority: High priority first
- Overdue: Past due, not done

**5. Mobile Capture**
- Set up Notion quick add widget
- Voice-to-text for fast capture
- Photos for visual info
- Review and process from desktop

### Tool Consolidation

**Choose one primary system**:
- Notion (recommended)
- Todoist
- Things
- Obsidian

**Avoid**:
- Multiple task managers
- Scattered notes in different apps
- No single source of truth

**Exception**: Specialized tools for specific needs (time tracking, habits, etc.) that integrate with primary system.

### Backup Strategy

**Critical data to backup**:
- Tasks and projects
- Notes and documentation
- Time tracking data
- Goal progress

**How**:
- Notion: Export to markdown monthly
- Calendar: Synced with iCloud/Google
- Files: Cloud storage (Dropbox, Drive)
- Automation: Regular exports via scripts

## Productivity Killers to Avoid

### 1. Productivity Porn

**The trap**: Endlessly consuming productivity content instead of producing.

**Solution**: 
- Limit consumption to 10% of time
- Implement immediately
- One new system per month max
- Action > optimization

### 2. Over-Engineering

**The trap**: Spending more time building systems than using them.

**Solution**:
- Simple system well-executed > complex system ignored
- Set time limit for setup
- Focus on using, not perfecting
- Iterate slowly

### 3. Task Hoarding

**The trap**: Never removing tasks, endless backlog.

**Solution**:
- Regular pruning
- If it's been there 3 months, delete or move to someday
- Realistic about capacity
- Say no more often

### 4. Context Switching

**The trap**: Constantly jumping between tasks.

**Solution**:
- Time blocking
- Batch similar tasks
- Single-task during deep work
- Disable notifications

### 5. Perfectionism

**The trap**: Never finishing because it's not perfect.

**Solution**:
- Done > perfect
- Set "good enough" criteria
- Time-box work
- Embrace iterative improvement

### 6. No Boundaries

**The trap**: Always available, always working.

**Solution**:
- Set work hours
- Evening shutdown routine
- Weekend protection
- Communicate boundaries
- Use Do Not Disturb

## Advanced Strategies

### Eat the Frog

Do your hardest/most important task first thing.

**Why**:

- "Email: 20 minutes"

**When time is up, move on** (even if not perfect).

### The Pomodoro Technique

**Method**:
1. Choose task
2. Set timer for 25 minutes
3. Work until timer rings
4. Take 5-minute break
5. After 4 pomodoros, take 15-30 minute break

**Benefits**:

- **Friday**: Review & Learning

**Benefits**: Know what to expect, easier to say no to misaligned requests.

### 20-Second Rule

**Make good habits 20 seconds easier**:
- Keep guitar on stand (not in case)
- Prep meals ahead
- Lay out workout clothes

**Make bad habits 20 seconds harder**:
- Unplug TV after each use
- Delete social media apps
- Put phone in another room

**Small friction changes behavior.**

## Final Pro Tips

### 1. Review This Guide Quarterly

Come back every 3 months to find new insights as you grow.

### 2. Share Your System

Teaching others solidifies your understanding and keeps you accountable.

### 3. Experiment Deliberately

Try new techniques one at a time for at least 2 weeks before judging.

### 4. Customize Ruthlessly

Adapt everything to your context. There is no one-size-fits-all.

### 5. Measure What Matters

Track only what you'll actually use to make decisions.

### 6. Celebrate Small Wins

Completed your morning routine? Celebrate. Finished top 3 tasks? Celebrate. Hit weekly goal? Celebrate.

Positive reinforcement builds momentum.

### 7. Be Kind to Yourself

You will miss tasks. You will break habits. You will have off weeks.

This is normal. Progress, not perfection.

### 8. The 1% Rule

Improve 1% each week. In one year, you'll be 50x better.

Small consistent improvement > sporadic intensity.
