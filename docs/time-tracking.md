6:00-10:00  | Personal Time
10:00-11:00 | Evening Routine
```

**Step 2: Assign Energy Levels**

- **Peak Energy (7-9 AM, 1-3 PM)**: Creative work, strategic thinking, writing
- **High Energy (9-12 PM)**: Meetings, problem-solving, collaboration
- **Moderate Energy (3-5 PM)**: Routine work, email, admin
- **Low Energy (5-7 PM)**: Exercise, relaxation, light tasks

**Step 3: Theme Your Days** (Optional)

- **Monday**: Planning & Meetings
- **Tuesday**: Deep Work (Maker Day)
- **Wednesday**: Collaboration & Calls
- **Thursday**: Deep Work (Maker Day)
- **Friday**: Review & Learning

### Implementing Time Blocks

**Daily Process:**

1. **Morning Planning** (10 min)
   - Review time blocks for today
   - Assign specific tasks to each block
   - Identify potential conflicts
   - Add buffer time between blocks

2. **During the Day**
   - Honor the blocks (don't switch tasks mid-block)
   - If urgent items arise, note them for next available block
   - Take breaks between blocks
   - Batch similar tasks within blocks

3. **Evening Review** (5 min)
   - Note: Which blocks were productive?
   - Capture: What threw you off schedule?
   - Adjust: How to improve tomorrow?

**Buffer Time**: Always include 15-30 min buffers between blocks for transitions, overruns, and emergencies.

- Internal: Business development

**Target Ratios:**
- 60-70% billable hours = healthy
- Below 50% = need more clients or efficiency
- Above 80% = risk of burnout, no growth time

**Weekly Tracking Template:**

```
Week of [Date]

Billable Hours: X
Non-billable Hours: X
Total Work Hours: X
Billable %: X%

Top Clients:
1. Client A: X hours
2. Client B: X hours
3. Client C: X hours

Actions:
- [Insight or adjustment needed]
```

### Project Time Tracking

**Why Track by Project:**
- Understand project profitability
- Improve future estimates
- Identify scope creep
- Make data-driven decisions

**Notion Setup:**

Create Time Entries database:

| Task | Relation | Link to task |
| Duration | Number | Hours worked |
| Description | Text | What was accomplished |
| Billable | Checkbox | Is it billable? |
| Rate | Number | Hourly rate if applicable |

**Reports to Generate:**
1. Time by project (this week/month)
2. Estimated vs. actual time
3. Time remaining on project
4. Most time-consuming projects

### Time Audit Process

**Quarterly Time Audit** (2-3 hours):

**1. Gather Data**

- Categorize all activities
- Calculate totals by category

**2. Analyze**
- What took more time than expected?
- What activities produced the most value?
- What activities produced the least value?
- Where did you procrastinate?

**3. Identify Patterns**
- When are you most productive?
- What triggers time waste?
- Which projects energize or drain you?

**4. Make Decisions**
- What to do more of?
- What to do less of?
- What to delegate or eliminate?
- What to automate?

**5. Set Goals**
- Time allocation targets for next quarter
- Specific habit changes
- Systems to implement

## Time Tracking Best Practices

### Do's

✅ **Start simple**: Track broad categories first
✅ **Be consistent**: Track every day for accurate data
✅ **Review regularly**: Weekly at minimum
✅ **Use data for decisions**: Don't just collect, act on insights
✅ **Automate when possible**: Reduce tracking friction
✅ **Track energy, not just time**: Quality > quantity
✅ **Include breaks**: They're part of sustainable productivity
✅ **Be honest**: Only useful if you track reality

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't obsess over every minute**: General patterns matter most
❌ **Don't track without purpose**: Have clear goals
❌ **Don't judge yourself**: Data is for learning, not guilt
❌ **Don't track forever**: Periodic tracking (1-2 weeks per quarter) is often enough
❌ **Don't ignore the data**: If you're not going to use it, don't collect it
❌ **Don't optimize too early**: Collect 2 weeks of data before making changes

## Integration with Other Systems

### Time Tracking + Task Management

**In Notion:**
1. Add "Time Estimate" property to tasks
2. Add "Time Actual" property to tasks
3. Calculate variance: Actual - Estimate
4. Use variance to improve future estimates

**Benefits:**
- Better planning
- Realistic commitments
- Identify time sinks

### Time Tracking + Goals

**Weekly Review:**
1. Check time spent on goal-related projects
2. Compare to desired allocation
3. Adjust next week's schedule

**Example:**
- Goal: Launch online course
- Desired time: 10 hours/week
- Actual time: 3 hours/week
- Action: Block 2 hours daily for course work

### Time Tracking + Habits

**Track habit execution time:**
- Morning routine: 45 minutes
- Exercise: 30 minutes
- Learning: 60 minutes
- Planning: 15 minutes

**Use data to:**
- Ensure habits fit in schedule
- Identify time for new habits
- Optimize habit duration

## Troubleshooting

### "I forget to track time"

**Solutions:**
- Use automatic tracking tools
- Set hourly reminders
- Batch track at day's end
- Pair with existing habit (e.g., track when reviewing tasks)

### "Tracking feels burdensome"

**Solutions:**
- Simplify categories
- Track less frequently (every 2-3 hours)
- Use automatic tools
- Time-box tracking periods (1 week per month)

### "I don't know what to do with the data"

**Solutions:**
- Set specific questions to answer
- Follow analysis template
- Share data with accountability partner
- Focus on one change at a time

### "My days are too unpredictable"

**Solutions:**
- Track in broad categories
- Focus on patterns over weeks, not days
- Identify "must protect" time blocks
- Build flexibility into schedule

## Conclusion

Time tracking is a powerful tool for understanding and optimizing how you spend your days. Start with simple tracking, gather data without judgment, and use insights to make intentional changes.

Remember: **The goal isn't to track every second—it's to gain awareness and make better decisions about how you spend your time.**
