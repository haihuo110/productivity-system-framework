## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Who Decided |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Jan 20 | Use Next.js instead of Gatsby | Better performance, easier deployment | Me |
| Jan 25 | Host on Vercel instead of Netlify | Native Next.js support, simpler setup | Me |
| Feb 5 | Use MDX for blog instead of CMS | More control, no additional service needed | Me |
| Feb 18 | Keep design minimal | Showcases content, faster to build | Me + Sarah |
| Mar 8 | Extend content phase by 5 days | Quality over speed, still hits launch date | Me |

### Lessons Learned (So Far)

**Things that went well:**
1. Starting with mockups saved time in development
2. Choosing Next.js was the right decision - fast and easy
3. Breaking project into clear phases helped maintain focus
4. Getting early design feedback prevented rework

**Things that could be improved:**
1. Underestimated time for content creation - double initial estimate next time
2. Should have outlined blog posts before starting to write
3. Could have lined up beta testers earlier

**Key learnings:**
1. Content takes 2x longer than you think it will
2. Writing good copy is harder than writing good code
3. Having a project plan keeps you accountable
4. Shipping is better than perfecting

## Summary

This project is 72% complete and on track for a March 30 launch. All development work is complete, and I'm now in the content creation phase. The website looks great, performs well, and I'm excited to share it with the world!

**Next 2 weeks:** Finish content, test thoroughly, and launch! 🚀
