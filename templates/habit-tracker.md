## 💡 Tips for Success

### Never Miss Twice Rule

If you miss one day, make it your priority to complete the habit the next day.
- Missing once = accident
- Missing twice = beginning of a new pattern

Examples:
- I will meditate at 6:30 AM in my bedroom
- I will exercise at 5:00 PM at the gym
- I will journal at 9:00 PM at my desk

### Habit Stacking

**After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].**

Examples:
- After I pour my coffee, I will write 3 priorities
- After I brush my teeth, I will do 10 pushups
- After I close my laptop, I will meditate for 5 minutes

### Environment Design

**Make good habits obvious:**
- [Cue you'll place]
- [Cue you'll place]

**Make bad habits invisible:**
- [Temptation you'll remove]
- [Temptation you'll remove]
